    "We casn see that there are a lot of connections within the subclasses, especially the mostly female communty of class 5B is heavily interconnected, while in class 5A the 2 communties seem quite connected with each other. Looking at some central nodes, 1437 for example, the node that scored the heighest on the weighed degree, seems to be a link from orange (F-5B) to both  purple (mostly M-5A) and green (M-5B). Another interesting node is 1457, it seems like that is a girl from 5A that interacts quite a lot with other girls from 5B, but within her own class seems to interact more with the boys, hence her being in the more male dominated communty of 5A. Those different connections are also reflected in this node scoring high on the weighted degree list. 1443, a node with a high betweenness score, seems to quickly be the only link between blue(F-5A) and orange(F-5B) when increasing the treshold for the edges, so it is clear why its betweenness score is so high. Not all central nodes are bridge nodes though. An example of a central node that isn't a bridge node is node 1452. It scores 5th on the weighed degree list, but isn't connected strongly with any nodes outside of its community. However, the high score still makes sense since the node is so heavily connected within the community. One could conclude that some central nodes are bridges to other communities, while other central nodes are the main node within a community that connects to others within the community."

We can either continue dropping nodes untill no nodes are left, and then look at whichever subgraph had the highest density, or we can be extra greedy and stop straight away when we notice the density is no longer improving."

    "It seems that both the classifiers perform worse when using the hypernyms over the actual words. The frequency classifier seems to even have 'kind = 12' as a feature that indicates negative sentiment, which seems very strange. However, this could also be because a hyponym (the inverse of hypernym) of 'kind' is used frequently with a 'not' before it, but since 'not' is a stopword and we drop it, this meaning gets lost. This doesn't mean that the use of hypernyms is bad, this was a pretty brute force, not nuanced way of implementing hypernyms. Replacing words with their hypernym might make them more general, but it also loses parts of their meaning. I highly suspect that replacing only the less frequent words, that actually have something to gain from being more general, by their hypernyms, would result in a better accuracy. On top of that, I also made the assumption mentioned above. Including all synsets and hypernyms could also hurt the accuracy, but perhaps there is a better way of choosing which ones to use that could improve the accuracy."
